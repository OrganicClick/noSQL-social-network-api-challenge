## Description

This project involves building the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The application is designed to simulate the functionality of an e-commerce platform by implementing models for products, categories, tags, and product tags.

## User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Installation

1. Clone  the repo from GitHub by running:
    -git clone git@github.com:OrganicClick/e-commerce-back-end-challenge.git

2. Navigate into the project directory by running:
    -cd e-commerce-backend-challenge

3. Create a .env file and add your MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, and DB_NAME on a new line.

4. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.


## Usage

1. First, access mySQL and  run the following code to create the database and tables:
    - CREATE  DATABASE ecommerce_db;
    - USE ecommerce_db;
    - SOURCE db/schema.sql;

2. Exit mySQL to re-enter the CLI

3. To seed the database, run `npm run seed`. This will populate your database with test data.

4. To start the  server, run `npm start`. The server should now be listening at http://localhost:3001

5. Open the Insomnia application and enter http://localhost:3001 as the base URL

6. You should now be free to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the specified endpoints as outlined in the source code.

** NOTE: There are still some problems with getting the 'npm run seed' script to work. To fix this, you may have to restart the server or directly run "node seeds/index.js" in the CLI to get around this error.
